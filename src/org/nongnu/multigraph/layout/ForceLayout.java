/**
 * See "Graph Drawing by Force-directed Placement", Fruchterman & Reingold.
 * <p>
 * This algorithm tries to layout a graph as if the nodes are repelled by each 
 * other, exponentially more so as they get closer to each other, while at the 
 * same time the edges act like springs to pull nodes together. These are
 * combined to give each node a velocity and momentum, acting in tension on
 * other nodes. If node's have a mass, this is taken into account.
 * <p>
 * The algorithm takes a number of iterations to reach equilibrium, presuming 
 * there are no other forces acting on the graph.
 * <p>
 * The behaviour of the algorithm is can be tuned by a number of parameters.
 * Unfortunately, different graphs may require different values for certain
 * parameters for best effect.
 * @param <N> The type of the Nodes in the graph
 * @param <E> The type of the Edges in the graph
