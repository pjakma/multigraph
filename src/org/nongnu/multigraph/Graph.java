/**
 * General Graph interface, for graphs of N-typed nodes, each having
 * 0 or more edges to other nodes, labeled L.
 * <p>
 * Edges may optionally be weighted, otherwise they are assigned a default
 * weight of 1. Weights of edges may be revised.
 * <p>
 * This interface does not specify how many edges are allowed between nodes 
 * and does specify whether a node may have an edge to itself, or not. A 
 * graph which explicitly allows both these cases is called a "multi-graph",
 * a graph which does not allow either condition is called a "simple-graph".
 * <p>
 * This interface does not restrict whether edges are directed or not. Where
 * edges are directed, then the presence of an edge out from one node to another
 * does not imply that the other node has a corresponding edge back. Where edges
 * are undirected, then the presence of an edge at one node must imply the presence
 * of a similar edge at the other node.
 * <p>
 * This interface does not allow for "hyper-graphs", where 1 edge may connect
 * to multiple nodes, however hyper-graphs can be supported by using a node to act
 * as hyper-edge.
 * 
 * @param N The type of the Nodes in the graph
 * @param E The type of the Edges in the graph
